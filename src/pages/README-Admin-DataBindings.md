# Admin Control Center – DocFlow AI

## Data-Binding IDs for Dynamic Placeholders

Use these IDs to bind real-time data to the Admin dashboard:

- `TOTAL_DOCS_PROCESSED` – Total number of documents processed
- `AGENT_UPTIME` – Agent uptime percentage
- `FAILED_COUNT` – Number of failed documents/events
- `AVG_LATENCY_MS` – Average system latency in milliseconds
- `ADMIN_NAME` – Name of the logged-in admin

These IDs are used as `data-id` attributes or variable references in the code for easy integration with your backend or real-time data sources.
